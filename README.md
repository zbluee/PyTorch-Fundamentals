# PyTorch Fundamentals

Learning PyTorch by implementing core ML/DL concepts from the ground up.

## 🎯 Goal

Build intuition for neural networks by implementing everything from scratch using minimal PyTorch functions.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install torch matplotlib numpy
python 01_linear_regression/00_linear_regression_gradient_descent.py
```

## Progress

- [x] Linear Regression with Manual Gradient Descent
- [x] Linear Regression with PyTorch Autograd
- [ ] Logistic Regression
- [x] Single-Layer Perceptron
- [x] Multi-Layer Perceptron
- [x] ConvNets

## Learning Approach

Each implementation includes:

- Mathematical explanation
- Step-by-step code comments
- Visualization of results
- Performance analysis
